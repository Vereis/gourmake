Cognitive Cooking: Applying Computational Creativity to Recipe Generation
    
    - System that generates surprising yet flavourful recipes
    - Can reason about flavour the same way we use our palate
    - Database of recipes, ingredients, flavor compounds, food pairing theories, 
      psychological data of human taste perception
    - Comb through recipe db learning about ingredient pairing, cuisine pairing,
      dish composition.
    - Cross reference data on chemistry of ingredients, psychology of people likes
      and dislikes (hedonic perception theory).
    - Hard to scale


Cognition as a part of Computational Creativity

    - Recipe generation is mix of Creativity and Cognition
    - Design componant informed by cognition, but not cognitive
    - Human flavour perception:
        - Emotional/Memory Related
        - Basic tasts: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami
        - Smell is key contributor to flavour perception; 10s - 100s of flavour compounds
          per ingredient
        - Temperature
        - Texture
        - Astringency
        - Creaminess
        - Color/Shape/Sound
    - Dish is the basic unit of creation
    - Dishes are combinations of recipe design and culinary skill (how to cook food)
    - Requires a suitable domain knowledge database
    - Repository of food ingredients and existing recipes, culinary styles, cuisines,
      flavour compounds
    - Genetic algorithms well suited?
    - Flavour pairing hypothesis
    - Olfactory pleasantness maximization
    - Data Model:
        - Recipe = {Ingredients List, Tool List, Cooking Steps}
        - Must include cultural context, human ratings, chemical analysis of ingredients,
          processes and so on
        - Name of dish
        - Regional Cuisine
    - Assessment:
        - Novelty, different in probability distribution of ingredient combinations
        - Bayesian Surprise
        - Pleasantness, can rely on topological polar surface area, heavy atom count,
          rotatable bond count, hydrogen bond acceptor count.


Soup Over Bean of Pure Joy: Culinary Ruminations of an Artificial Chef

    - Inspiring set contains ~5000 soups, stew and chilli recipes, with normalised
      ingredient measurements
    - Groups and sub groups:
        - Fruits and vegs > Beans, Fruits, Leafy Greens.
        - Beans > Butter Beans, Kidney Beans etc
    - Uses a genetic algorithm:
        - Mutation modeled as change of one ingredient to another, addition of an
          ingredient or deletion of an ingredient
        - Crossover is simple one point crossover
        - Fitness Function:
            - Relationship of major groups compared to correct usual amounts
            - Other NN learning
    - Because of atypicalities such as "a dash of green beans", recipes are discarded
      from places such as 'food.com'


New Developments in Culinary Computational Creativity

    - Personalization of dish evaluation? "I like meat"
    - Optimization of dish quality and novelty
    - Consider flavor preference and novelty evaluation followed by apation/search
    - Consider subbing foods, meat -> plant based alternative
    - Odor Similarity as a model for flavour enhancement, balance and substitution
    - Perceptual similarity of odorant-mixtures can be pridicted
